## Building the Provider

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/infobloxopen/terraform-provider-infoblox
$ cd terraform-provider-infoblox
$ make build
```

## Using the Provider
If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin). After the build is complete, copy the `terraform-provider-infoblox` binary into the same path as your terraform binary. After placing it into your plugins directory, run `terraform init` to initialize it.

## Developing the Provider
If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need Go installed on your machine (version 1.12+ is required).

To compile the provider, run the following steps:
```sh
$ make build
...
$ ./terraform-provider-infoblox
...
```
To test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.
```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of acceptance tests `make testacc`.
```sh
$ make testacc
```
## Features of Provider
### Resource
* Creation & Deletion of Network View in NIOS appliance
* Creation & Deletion of IPv4 Network with EAs and comment fields in NIOS appliance
* Allocation & Deallocation of IPv4 address from an IPv4 Network
* Association & Disassociation of IPv4 Address for a VM
* Creation and Deletion of A, CNAME, Host, and PTR records

### Data Source
* Supports Data Source for IPv4 Network
* Support Data Source for A and CNAME records

## Disclaimer
To use the provider for DNS purposes, a parent (i.e. zone) must already exist. The plugin does not support the creation of zones.
