# IPv4 Network Resource

The `infoblox_ipv4_network` resource enables you to perform `create`, `update` and `delete` operations
on IPv4 networks. Network resources support the next available network feature when you use
the `allocate_prefix_len` parameter in the below list.

The following list describes the parameters you can define in a `infoblox_ipv4_network` resource block:

* `network_view`: optional, specifies the network view in which to create the network; the default value is `default`.
* `cidr`: required only if `parent_cidr` is not set; specifies the network block to use for the network, in CIDR notation. Do not use an IPv6 CIDR for an IPv4 network. If you configure both `cidr` and `parent_cidr`, the value of `parent_cidr` is ignored.
* `parent_cidr`: required only if `cidr` is not set; specifies the network container from which the network must be dynamically allocated. The network container must exist in the NIOS database, but not necessarily as a Terraform resource.
* `allocate_prefix_len`: required only if `parent_cidr` is set; defines the length of the network part of the address for a network that should be allocated from a network container, which in turn is determined by `parent_cidr`.
* `gateway`: optional, defines the IP address of the gateway within the network block. If a value is not set, the first IP address of the allocated network is assigned as the gateway address. If the value of the gateway parameter is set as `none`, no value is assigned.
* `ext_attrs`: optional, specifies the set of NIOS extensible attributes that will be attached to the network.
* `reserve_ip`: optional, specifies the number of IPv4 addresses that you want to reserve in the IPv4 network. The default value is 0

!> Once a network object is created, the `reserve_ip` and `gateway` fields cannot be edited.

!> IP addresses that are reserved by setting the `reserve_ip` field are used for network maintenance by the cloud providers. Therefore, Infoblox does not recommend using these IP addresses for other purposes.

### Examples of an IPv4 Network Block

```hcl
// statically allocated IPv4 network, minimal set of parameters
resource "infoblox_ipv4_network" "net1" {
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

// full set of parameters for statically allocated IPv4 network
resource "infoblox_ipv4_network" "net2" {
  cidr = "10.1.0.0/24"
  network_view = "nondefault_netview"
  reserve_ip = 5
  gateway = "10.1.0.254"
  comment = "small network for testing"
  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Site" = "bla-bla-bla... testing..."
  })
}

// full set of parameters for dynamically allocated IPv4 network
resource "infoblox_ipv4_network" "net3" {
  parent_cidr = infoblox_ipv4_network_container.v4net_c1.cidr // reference to the resource from another example
  allocate_prefix_len = 26 // 24 (existing network container) + 2 (new network), prefix
  network_view = "default" // we may omit this but it is not a mistake to specify explicitly
  reserve_ip = 2
  gateway = "none" // no gateway defined for this network
  comment = "even smaller network for testing"
  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Site" = "any place you wish ..."
  })
}
```
