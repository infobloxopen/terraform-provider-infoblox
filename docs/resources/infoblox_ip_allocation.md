# IP Allocation Resource

The `infoblox_ip_allocation` resource allows allocation of a new IP address from a network that already exists as a NIOS object. The IP address can be allocated statically by specifying an address or dynamically as the next available IP address from the specified IPv4 and/or IPv6 network blocks. The allocation is done by creating a host record in NIOS with an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or both assigned to the record. The allocated IP address is marked as ‘used’ in the appropriate network block.

-> As a prerequisite for creation of Host records using the `infoblox_ip_allocation` and `infoblox_ip_association` resources, you must create the extensible attribute `Terraform Internal ID` of string type in Infoblox NIOS Grid Manager. For steps, refer to the [Infoblox NIOS Documentation] (https://docs.infoblox.com/display/ILP/NIOS).

The following list describes the parameters you can define in the `infoblox_ip_allocation` resource block:

* `fqdn`: required, specifies the name (in FQDN format) of a host with which an IP address needs to be allocated.
  In a cloud environment, a VM name could be used as a host name.
  For a host record with its name in FQDN format and the
  `enable_dns` flag enabled, if you disable the flag,
  you must remove the zone part from the record name and
  keep only the host name.
  For example, hostname1.zone.com must be changed to `hostname1`.
  Example: ` ip-12-34-56-78.us-west-2.compute.internal`.
* `network_view`: optional, specifies the network view from which to get the specified network block.
  If a value is not specified, the name `default` is set as the network view. Example: `dmz_netview`.
* `dns_view`: optional, specifies the DNS view in which to create the DNS
  resource records that are associated with the IP address.
  * If `enable_dns` is set to `true`, you must configure this parameter.
  * If `enable_dns` is set to `false`, you must remove this parameter from the resource block.

  For more information, see the description of the enable_dns parameter.
  Example: `external`.
* `enable_dns`: optional, a flag that specifies whether DNS records associated with the resource must be created. The default value is `true`.
  When you update the enable_dns parameter, consider the following points:
  * If you set the parameter to `false` when **creating** a resource, you must not specify the `dns_view` parameter.
  * If you set the parameter to `false` when **updating** a resource, you must:
    * Remove the `dns_view` parameter. Not removing it can result in unexpected errors.
    * Remove the zone part in the FQDN and keep only the host record name.
      For example, the FQDN with `host1` as the record name and zone as `example.org`, must be changed from `host1.example.org` to `host1`.
  * If you set the parameter from `false` to `true`, you must:
    * Specify the `dns_view` parameter because if a value is not specified, the name `default` is NOT configured.
    *  Change the `fqdn` value to FQDN without a leading dot, that means, add a zone that exists in the specified DNS view to the
       name of the host record. For example, if the `fqdn` value is `host1` and the zone
       selected from the specified DNS view is `example.com`, then the `fqdn` must be changed to `host1.example.com`.
* `ipv4_cidr`: required only for dynamic allocation, specifies the IPv4 network block (in CIDR format) from where to allocate the next available IP address.
  Use this parameter only when `ipv4_addr` is not specified. Example: `10.0.0.0/24`.
* `ipv6_cidr`: required only for dynamic allocation, specifies the IPv6 network block (in CIDR format) from where to allocate the next available IP address.
  Use this parameter only when `ipv6_addr` is not specified. Example: `2000:1148::/32`.
* `ipv4_addr`: required only for static allocation, specifies an IPv4 address to allocate. 
  Use this parameter only when `ipv4_cidr` is not specified. The allocated IP address will be marked as ‘Used’ in NIOS Grid Manager.
  The default value is an empty string. If you specify both `ipv4_addr` and `ipv4_cidr`, then `ipv4_addr` is ignored.
  Example: `10.0.0.10`.
* `ipv6_addr`: required only for static allocation, specifies an IPv6 address to allocate.
  Use this parameter only when `ipv6_cidr` is not specified. The allocated IP address will be marked as ‘Used’ in NIOS Grid Manager.
  The default value is an empty string. If you specify both `ipv6_addr` and `ipv6_cidr`, then the `ipv6_addr` address is allocated and `ipv6_cidr` is ignored.
  Example: `2000:1148::10`.
* `ttl`: optional, specifies the 'time to live' value for the DNS record. This parameter is relevant only when `enable_dns` is set to `true`.
  If a value is not specified, then in NIOS, the value is inherited from the parent zone of the DNS records for this resource. Example: `3600`.
* `comment`: optional, specifies the human-readable description of the resource. Example: `Front-end cloud node`.
* `ext_attrs`: optional, specifies the set of NIOS extensible attributes that are attached to the NIOS resource.
  An extensible attribute must be a JSON map translated into a string value. Example:
```
jsonencode({
  "Tenant ID" = "tf-plugin"
  "Location" = "Test loc."
  "Site" = "Test site"
})
```

When you use the `infoblox_ip_allocation` resource block to allocate or deallocate a static IP address from a Host record,
you must configure appropriate dependencies so that workflows run in the correct order. In the following example,
dependencies have been configured for network view and the extensible attribute, `Network Name`:

```hcl
resource "infoblox_ip_allocation" "ip_allocation" {
  network_view = infoblox_ipv6_network.ipv6_network.network_view
  ipv4_addr = "10.0.0.32"
  ipv6_addr = "2001:1890:1959:2710::32"

  #Create Host Record with DNS flags
  dns_view="default"
  fqdn="testipv4v6"
  enable_dns = "false"

  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Tenant ID" = "tf-plugin"
    "Network Name" = lookup(jsondecode(infoblox_ipv4_network.ipv4_network.ext_attrs), "Network Name")
    "VM Name" = "tf-vmware-ipv4-ipv61"
    "Location" = "Test loc."
    "Site" = "Test site"
  })
}
```

When you perform a `create` or an `update` operation using this allocation resource, the following read-only parameters are computed:

* `allocated_ipv4_addr`: if you allocated a dynamic IP address, this value is the IP address allocated from the specified IPv4 CIDR.
  If you allocated a static IP address, this value is the IP address that you specified in the `ipv4_addr` field.
  You can reference this field for the IP address when using other resources. Example:
```hcl
resource "infoblox_ip_aloocation" "allocation1" {
  dns_view = "default"
  ipv4_cidr = infoblox_ipv4_network.cidr
  fqdn = local.vm_name
}
# You can add a reference for the IP address as follows: infoblox_ip_allocation.allocation1.allocated_ipv4_addr
```

* `allocated_ipv6_addr`: if you allocated a dynamic IP address, this value is the IP address allocated from the specified IPv6 CIDR.
  If you allocated a static IP address, this value is the IP address that you specified `ipv6_addr` field.
  You can reference this field for the IP address when using other resources. See the previous description for an example.

### Examples of a Resource Block

You can use static and dynamic allocation methods independently to assign IPv4 and IPv6 addresses within the same
resource.

```hcl
// IP address allocation, minimal set of parameters
resource "infoblox_ip_allocation" "allocation1" {
  dns_view = "default" // this time the parameter is not optional, because...
  # enable_dns = true // ... this is 'true', by default
  fqdn = "host1.example1.org" // this resource type is implemented as a host record on NIOS side
  ipv4_addr = "1.2.3.4"
}

// Wide set of parameters
resource "infoblox_ip_allocation" "allocation2" {
  dns_view = "nondefault_dnsview1"
  fqdn = "host2.example2.org"
  ipv6_addr = "2002:1f93::1234"
  ttl = 120
  comment = "another host record, statically allocated"
  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Tenant ID" = "tenant_3261798"
  })
}

// IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time
resource "infoblox_ip_allocation" "allocation3" {
  dns_view = "nondefault_dnsview2"
  network_view = "nondefault_netview" // we have to mention the exact network view which the DNS view belongs to
  fqdn = "host3.example4.org"
  ipv6_addr = "2002:1f93::12:40"
  ipv4_addr = "1.2.3.40"
  ttl = 0
  comment = "still statically allocated, but IPv4 and IPv6 together"
  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Tenant ID" = "tenant_3261798"
  })
}

resource "infoblox_ip_allocation" "allocation4" {
  enable_dns = false
  # dns_view = "nondefault_dnsview2" // dns_view makes no sense when enable_dns = false and
  // you MUST remove it or comment out
  network_view = "nondefault_netview" // we have to mention the exact network view which the DNS view belongs to
  fqdn = "host4" // just one name component, because there is no host-to-DNS-zone assignment

  // either of the IP addresses must belong to an existing
  // network (not a network container) in the GIVEN network view,
  // because of enable_dns = false
  ipv6_addr = "2002:1f93::12:40"
  ipv4_addr = "10.1.0.60"

  // we must ensure that appropriate network exists by the time this resource is being created
  depends_on = [infoblox_ipv4_network.net1]
}

// dynamic allocation
resource "infoblox_ip_allocation" "allocation5" {
  dns_view = "nondefault_dnsview2"
  network_view = "nondefault_netview"
  fqdn = "host5.example4.org"
  ipv6_cidr = infoblox_ipv6_network.net2.cidr
  ipv4_cidr = infoblox_ipv4_network.net2.cidr
}
```
