# IPv6 Network Resource

The `infoblox_ipv6_network` resource enables you to perform `create`, `update` and `delete` operations
on IPv6 networks. Network resources support the next available network feature when you use
the `allocate_prefix_len` parameter in the below list.

The following list describes the parameters you can define in a `infoblox_ipv6_network` resource block:

- `network_view`: optional, specifies the network view in which to create the network; the default value is `default`.
- `cidr`: required only if `parent_cidr` is not set; specifies the network block to use for the network, in CIDR notation. Do not use an IPv4 CIDR for an IPv6 network. If you configure both `cidr` and `parent_cidr`, the value of `parent_cidr` is ignored.
- `parent_cidr`: required only if `cidr` is not set; specifies the network container from which the network must be dynamically allocated. The network container must exist in the NIOS database, but not necessarily as a Terraform resource.
- `allocate_prefix_len`: required only if `parent_cidr` is set; defines the length of the network part of the address for a network that should be allocated from a network container, which in turn is determined by `parent_cidr`.
- `gateway`: optional, defines the IP address of the gateway within the network block. If a value is not set, the first IP address of the allocated network is assigned as the gateway address. If the value of the gateway parameter is set as `none`, no value is assigned.
- `ext_attrs`: optional, specifies the set of NIOS extensible attributes that will be attached to the network.
- `reserve_ipv6`: optional, specifies the number of IPv6 addresses that you want to reserve in the IPv6 network. The default value is 0
- `filter_params`: optional, specifies the extensible attributes of the parent network or network container that must be used as filters to retrieve the next available network for creating the network object. Example: `jsonencode({"*Site": "Turkey"})`.
- `object`: optional, specifies the type of object from which to allocate the network. The values can be `network` or `networkcontainer`. The default value is `networkcontainer`.

!> Once a network object is created, the `filter_params`, `reserve_ipv6` and `gateway` fields cannot be edited.

!> IP addresses that are reserved by setting the `reserve_ipv6` field are used for network maintenance by the cloud providers. Therefore, Infoblox does not recommend using these IP addresses for other purposes.

!> The object parameter is applicable only if filter_params is configured.
!> If the object parameter is set to network, after the creation of the network object, the parent network object will be converted to a network container object.

### Examples of an IPv6 Network Block

```hcl
// statically allocated IPv6 network, minimal set of parameters
resource "infoblox_ipv6_network" "net1" {
  cidr = "2002:1f93:0:3::/96"
}

// full set of parameters for statically allocated IPv6 network
resource "infoblox_ipv6_network" "net2" {
  cidr         = "2002:1f93:0:4::/96"
  network_view = "nondefault_netview"
  reserve_ipv6 = 10
  gateway      = "2002:1f93:0:4::1"
  comment      = "let's try IPv6"

  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Site" = "somewhere in Antarctica"
  })
}

// full set of parameters for dynamically allocated IPv6 network
resource "infoblox_ipv6_network" "net3" {
  parent_cidr         = infoblox_ipv6_network_container.v6net_c1.cidr // reference to the resource from another example
  allocate_prefix_len = 100                                           // 96 (existing network container) + 4 (new network), prefix
  network_view        = "default"                                     // we may omit this but it is not a mistake to specify explicitly
  reserve_ipv6        = 20
  gateway             = "none" // no gateway defined for this network
  comment             = "the network for the Test Lab"

  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Site" = "small inner cluster"
  })
}

//full set of parameters for dynamically allocated IPv6 network using filter_params
resource "infoblox_ipv6_network" "ipv6network1" {
  allocate_prefix_len = 67
  network_view        = "nondefault_netview"
  comment             = "IPV6 NW within a NW container"

  filter_params = jsonencode({
    "*Site": "Blr"
  })

  ext_attrs = jsonencode({
    "Site" = "UK"
  })

  object = "networkcontainer"
}
```
